                    Fort that is about 22 km from Gokarna. The huge fort is said to have been built in the 16th
                    century, close to the Mirjan Port which was used in the ancient times to export pepper,
                    saltpetre and nutmeg. The fort that stands in the bend of a creek in the Aghanashini River,
                    is truly well worth a visit. The green landscape surrounding it is a exceptionally quiet and
                    the rumble of the water beside provides with the natural noise to lighten up the place.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>There are many versions to the dating of this fort.
                    The first historical vision the Mirjan Fort was built initially by a Nawayath as per Ibn_Battuta
                    book
                    this fort was first built by Nawayath Sultanates early 1200, then it came under the Vijayanagara
                    Empire. Then the fort was refurbished in 1608 [Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)] refers to its
                    building over a period of 1608-1640) on the south east coastal part of the Tadri Creek.

                    Another version that is traced to the period 1552-1606 is that the Mirjan Fort was built initially
                    by Queen Chennabhairadevi. She was from the Tuluva-Saluva clan and ruled for a long period (for 54
                    years) under the protection of the Vijayanagara Empire (the queen preferred to be subordinate
                    (mahamandaleshwara) of Vijayanagar rulers), as the queen of Gersoppa (a small town on the northern
                    banks of the Sharavati River). She was given the epithet "The Pepper Queen or Raina Da Pimenta'.She
                    devoutly practiced Jainism and during her rule constructed many Jain basadis. She ruled "in
                    conformity with the doctrine of succession Aliyasantana or Matriarchal, a tradition followed in
                    coastal belt of Konkan and Kerala". Her domain covered North and South Kanara districts and south
                    Goa, which had important ports such as Malpe, Bidnoor, Mirjan, Honnavar, Ankola and Karwar from
                    where the pepper, the most important produce of the region, was shipped to Europe. However, she
                    suffered reverses after the Talikota war in which the Vijayanagar Empire was routed. She then
                    shifted from Mirjan Fort to a safe location in an island in the middle of the Sharavathi River.</p>
